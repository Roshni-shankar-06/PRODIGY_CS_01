Caesar Cipher - Python
This is a simple Python program to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

What is Caesar Cipher?
Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest encryption techniques. Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 3:
A becomes D, B becomes E, ..., Z becomes C.

Features
Encrypt a message by shifting letters forward.
Decrypt a message by shifting letters backward.
Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Leaves non-alphabet characters unchanged.
How to use
Run the program.
Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Enter the shift value (e.g., 3).
See the encrypted and decrypted outputs.
Example
Message: Hello, World! Shift: 3

Encrypted: Khoor, Zruog! Decrypted: Hello, World!
